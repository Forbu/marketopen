 -> 20 october 2017 : first prototype finsihed
 What is done ?
  - Ethereum backend (solidity smart contract)
      Improvement -> better optimization of memory to avoid paying high gas fees
                  -> finishing the comment section
  - Express + mongodb backend : 
      Improvement -> switch database (why using mongodb ? -> choose SQL seems simpler)
                  -> make clearer backend API -> create documentation for that
  - Angular frontend : 
      Improvement -> well create all the option (detail the products with seller data)
                  -> RPC provider option / publish product option / create seller+buyer option
                  -> actualize option
